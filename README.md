## Lyrics

```
login for your lost souls
gotta tell me what you really saw 
veiled thru the digits
on ones and zeros made a living 
fleeting egos in the space of cold

all of em bonded, nest of rot 
through the net botnets 
casted programs onto self

talking to each other what is what

made it offline
made it offline 
made it offline

made it offline
made it offline 
made it offline

1:08
pass on the pad coz it says what is right
dials on track, we are aligned
keep us aflight 


```
